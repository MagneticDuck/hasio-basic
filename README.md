# Hasio BASIC

Casio BASIC has inspired the coder-oriented minds of kids uninterested in math class for many years, but it's fairly clear that from any sort of relevant comparison that BASIC *sucks as a language*. It's extremely painful to implement any sort of non-trivial design pattern, lacking even the most basic constructs of code reusability and abstraction.

So, just for fun, I'm writing a little language with a minimal of good design that can, with very little impact in performance, be transpiled to Casio BASIC.

Yes, I know there is support to target gcc at prizm-executable bytecode. (https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6185). I'm doing this purely for fun.
